Do not forget to add environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH=<path_to_seastar>/build/release to CMake invocation!

Why dma_read() throws an exception but when make_file_input_stream() works?

Why make_file_input_stream() stream gives first bytes like that: 'FD377A58', but hexdump like that: '0000000 37fd 587a'?
